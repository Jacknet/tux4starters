                    <br>
                    Tux For Starters is the result of a Senior Project course at the University of South Florida (USF) during Spring of 2021 
                    where the group, <strong>The EDU Liberators</strong>, created this website to provide students who are new to the world
                    of UNIX and Linux operating systems a means to be able to learn about them.

                    <h3>Who created this?</h3>
                    <strong>The EDU Liberators</strong> are made up of the following USF students: Joaquin Padilla, Mayank Joshi, Justin Asbury, and Alexis Herrera.
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    Students are tasked with working on lessons that have them reading about these types of systems while also being able to interact with a
                    fascimile of a terminal to get them adjusted to using one if they decide to try out any of the operating
                    systems discussed.
                    <br>
                    Students are ranked on whether they were able to complete the assignment or answer any multiple choice questions without errors. As they
                    progress from lesson to lesson, they will have a means of tracking which items are completed through markers and color coding on the main
                    lessons page and after they have completed a lesson.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    <h3>How do I get started as a student?</h3>
